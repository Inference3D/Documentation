# Specialization Project #

This project is a specialization of the _SymReg_ project. What that means is that this project is a __specialized version__ of the _SymReg_ project. The main idea is that _SymReg_ will contain a set of general problem solving tools (along with the general problem solving pipeline), while this project will contain tools and resources particular to the problem at hand (refinement of 3D geometry estimation from data). This particular document is focused on just defining the **contract** of how this folder is related to _SymReg_ and what the expected resources in this folder should be.

## Expected Specialist Content ##

The following elements are the things that one would expect to find a specialist folder like this one:
* A definition of what the available data is in the particular problem space, and what one hopes to extract from this data.
* A folder containing important literature related to the problem at hand (what have other researchers tried in order to extract the required data from the proposed problem space).
* Some literature review notes about the various high-level approaches that people have tried, along with the "gaps" that I am exploring (why I think that my approach has promise, when I compare it to what others have tried).
* A diary folder. Basically this is one of the chores that I want to introduce this year as part of a **resolution**. The basic idea is that as I grapple with a particular problem, I expect to learn more about the problem. The diary is a useful tool in taking ones current understanding of a particular problem space, taking new evidence that has come to light, and refining or reformulating ones theory. It is expected that my diary will become more active as a get my experimental pipeline up and running and start refining with the hope of improving results.
* The main focus of a specialization is to take the data available in the specialized space and to formulate it so that it can be applied to a general problem solving approach. Therefore this folder is expected to contain a set of tools and utilities for extracting and processing the data specific to this space for general processing.
* Additional tools are expected to be in this project as well - verification and validation tests for example.
